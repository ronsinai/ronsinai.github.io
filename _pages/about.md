I'm a MSc student in the Department of Computer Science at Bar-Ilan University. Prior to that, I received my BSc in Computer Science from Tel-Aviv University.

My research interests include topics in deep representation learning and their applications for computer vision and natural language processing, AI explainability and interpretability.
